    "# Modules\n",
    "* Modules are just like readymade bread.\n",
    "* Modules refer to file conatining python statements and definitions.These are prewritten codes that are written by someone which can directly use your code.\n",
    "* We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files\n",
    "* We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definition into different programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#There are 3 types of modules,\n",
    "* Built-in modules\n",
    "* Third party modules\n",
    "* Custom modules\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in modules\n",
    "* As the name suggests, built-in modules are the modules that are available in Python by default.These modules are developed and maintained by the Python developer team.\n",
    "* Thus, to use such modules, you can directly import them into your file and just make the call to the methods that you need.\n",
    "* For instance, the math module is a built-in module in python that provides various mathematical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Third party modules\n",
    "* These modules are just like the built-in modules in Python. The only major difference is that we need to install them first.\n",
    "* Once they are installed, you can use them just like the built-in modules.\n",
    "* Third-party modules can be installed using the 'pip' command. PIP is a package manager for Python packages.\n",
    "* These modules are uploaded and stored at the PyPI repository. The Python Package Index, abbreviated as PyPI is the official third-party software        repository for Python.\n",
    "* Following is the syntax to download the third- party modules. Hit this command in the command-line/terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#For windows : \n",
    "pip install module_name\n",
    "\n",
    "#For MacOs/Linux : \n",
    "pip3 install module_name\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom modules\n",
    "* Python custom modules are the modules created by the developer.\n",
    "* These modules are simple Python files that can be imported into another Python file/project.\n",
    "* Once imported, you can access all the attributes and methods of the imported file.Such files are called Python custom modules.\n",
    "* This allows you to reuse your code in the same project and also helps you write efficient and fewer lines of code."

    "# How to use Modules\n",
    "There are 3 ways of using python modules,\n",
    "* The import statement\n",
    "* Import statement and renaming\n",
    "* The form...import statement\n",
    "\n",
    "## The import statement\n",
    "* We can use the import keyword to do this\n",
    "* To import the module, we can use the following statement,\n",
    "* import module_name\n",
    "* This will import the whole module into your Python project.\n",
    "* To use the various functions provided by the respective module, we can use the dot (.) operator as shown below,\n",
    "\n",
    "#module_name.functionName()\n",
    "* Where,module_name is the name of the Python module.\n",
    "* functionName() is the name of the function we wish to use from that particular module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Renaming a module\n",
    "* There are situations were the module name is little lengthy.\n",
    "* In such situations, we can rename the module's name while importing it.\n",
    "* We can use the import...as syntax that allows us to do the same. The as keyword helps us in renaming the module as shown below,\n",
    "#import module_name as m\n",
    "* module_name is the name of the Python module.\n",
    "* 'm' is the new name given to it that can be â€¢ used to refer to the module further in the project.\n",
    "#For example,\n",
    "* Instead of using the syntax, module_name.functionName(), we can use m.functionName().\n",
    "\n",
    "##  The form...import statement\n",
    "* Let's say you want to buy an egg, just one egg. In such a situation, will it make sense to buy the whole egg tray? Of course not!\n",
    "* Similarly, assume that there is some situation where you need a particular attribute/function/ class from a module.\n",
    "* Then importing the whole module can make your project heavy and a bit slow.\n",
    "* We can use the from...import syntax which allows us to import only the particular name(attribute/function/class) that we want from a module.\n",
    "#Following is the syntax to do so,\n",
    "* from module_name import functionName\n",
    "\n",
    "How to use?\n",
    "* We know that we can use a particular attribute/ function from a module using the dot operator.\n",
    "* But, how to use it in the case of from...import syntax?\n",
    "* It is pretty simple.\n",
    "* Since we have just imported only the particular name from the module that we want, we can directly use it without referring to the module_name using * the dot syntax as shown below,\n",
